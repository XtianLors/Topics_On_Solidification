# Solidification

This repository is meant to provide functions to calculate the energy required to have a proper nucleation of a metalic liquid species. It is a meaningful operation since nucleation can be controlled to produce monocrystals useful in the semiconductor and embedded devices industry. The repository also provides physical constants that are steppingstones for the thermodynamical understanding of solidification.

## Nucleation
Nucleation is the process of solidification of a liquid species. In this case we are going to focus on the solidification of metals.

As mentioned by Javad, Hashemi (). Energies Involved in Homogeneous Nucleation In the homogeneous nucleation of a solidifying pure metal, two kinds of energy changes must be considered: (1) the volume (or bulk) free energy released by the liquid-to-solid transformation and (2) the surface energy required to form the new solid surfaces of the solidified particles.
